## Math Operators
Used to perform mathematical operations, __(AKA. Arithmetic operators)__

1. Addition, `+	`
2. Subtraction, `-`
3. Multiplication, `*` 
4. Division, `/` (Exact Answer)
	 Division, `//` (Quotient)
5. Modulo, `%`	(Remainder)
6. Exponent, `**`

*Ex.*
`print (2 + 1)`
	> 3

`print (5 % 3)`
	> 2

`print (2 ** 3)`
	> 8


## Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

0. Simple Assignment, `=`
1. Addition Assignment, `+=`
2. Subtract Assignment, `-=`
3. Multiple Assignment, `*=`
4. Divide Assignment, `/=`
	 Divide Assignment, `//=`
5. Modulo Assignment, `%=`
6. Exponent Assignment, `**=`

### Rule: Using Assignment Operators
A variable must be declared before using assignment operators with the variable.

*Ex.*
`a = 5`
`a += 2` # equivalent to `a = a + 2`
`print (a)`
	> 7


## Comparison Operators
Used to compare values for conditions. Return booleans after evalutions.

1. equal to, `a == b`
2. not equal to, `a != b`
3. less than, `a < b`
4. less than or equal to, `a <=b `
5. greater than, `a > b`
6. greater than or equal to, `a >= b`

### Rule: Using Comparion Operators
Two objects are required such as a variable or a raw data/value.

*Ex.*
`a = 5`
`print (a > 4)`
	> True

`print (5 < 4)`
	> False
